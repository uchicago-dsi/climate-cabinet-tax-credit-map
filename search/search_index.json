If it fails, it retries on an interval until a maximum number of seconds has elapsed\u2014at which point it throws an error.</p> </li> <li> <p>Creates New Migrations.  The pipeline runs <code>manage.py makemigrations</code> to detect any changes in the Django ORM models. If a model class has changed, a new migration file is written under the <code>pipeline/tax_credit/migrations</code> folder to later move to the updated schema.</p> </li> <li> <p>Migrates Schemas. The pipeline runs <code>manage.py migrate</code> to apply any newly-detected migration file(s) to the database.

After the tables and indices have been created, the pipeline runs <code>manage.py clean_data</code>. This custom command reads raw input files from the configured data store, cleans and standardizes the data to conform to the <code>tax_credit_geography</code> table schema described above, and then writes the resulting output geographies to the data store as geoparquet and geojsonl files.</p> </li> <li> <p>Loads Geographies. The pipeline then runs <code>manage.py load_geos</code>. This custom command reads each cleaned geoparquet file from the data store one by one and bulk inserts its records into the <code>tax_credit_geography</code> database table, ignoring unique constraint violations when they occur.</p> </li> <li> <p>Load Associations. Once the geographies are loaded, the pipeline runs <code>manage.py load_associations</code>. This custom command computes spatial intersections between all combinations of target and bonus geography types and estimates the number of persons living in those intersections. The population estimation is achieved by matching geographies on a common state or county FIPS code when possible, or by summing the populations of census block group population-weighted centroids that fall into the intersections. Finally, the association records are mapped to the schema for the <code>tax_credit_target_bonus_overlap</code> table outlined above and bulk inserted into the database.</p> </li> <li> <p>Sync Tilesets. Finally, the pipeline runs <code>manage.py sync_tilesets</code>, which syncs the remote Mapbox tilesets with the tilesets defined by the cleaned geojsonl files and configuration settings.

A TIGER/Line Shapefile for 2020 containing a total of 33,791 ZIP Code Tabulation Areas. It is important to note that ZIP Codes differ from ZCTAs, as documented by the U.S. Census Bureau:</p> <p>First introduced in 1963, ZIP Code is a trademark of the USPS created to coordinate mail handling and delivery. The USPS assigns ZIP Code ranges to regional post offices, which in turn assign ZIP Codes to delivery routes. Each delivery route is composed of street networks, and/or individual units with high mail volumes, such as high-rise buildings or individual business locations. Within the Census Bureau\u2019s MAF/TIGER System, ZIP Codes are stored as one component of discrete addresses tied to delivery points, including specific housing unit locations. The result is a point-based dataset unsuitable for mapping and many analysis applications.</p> <p>ZCTAs are generalized areal representations of the geographic extent and distribution of the point-based ZIP Codes built using 2020 Census tabulation blocks. The Census Bureau is restricted by Title 13 from releasing individual housing unit addresses or location information to the public, so point-based ZIP Code data are unsuitable for distribution and publication. However, by aggregating the points and extrapolating them to a polygonal-based unit (census tabulation blocks), disclosure concerns can be addressed and \u201cgeographic subtraction*\u201d is prevented.</p> <p>Metadata</p> Geographic Coverage 50 U.S. states, the District of Columbia, and the six territories of American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Marina Islands, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands Coordinate Reference System EPSG 4269 Publisher U.S. Census Bureau Availability May be downloaded through the U.S. Census Bureau's web tool or FTP server <p>Fields</p> Field Data Type Non-Null Count Description Example ZCTA5CE20 string The five-digit ZIP Code Tabulation Area code. <code>\"35592\"</code> GEOID20 string The five-digit ZIP Code Tabulation Area code. <code>\"35592\"</code> CLASSFP20 string The 2020 Census FIPS 55 class code. <code>\"B5\"</code> MTFCC20 string The MAF/TIGER feature class code, equal to G6350. <code>\"G6350\"</code> FUNCSTAT20 string The current functional status code. <code>\"S\"</code> ALAND20 integer The current land area. <code>298552385</code> AWATER20 integer The current water area. <code>298552385</code> INTPTLAT20 string The current latitude of the 's internal point.
